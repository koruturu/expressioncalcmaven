Hi,

I have implemented the coding exercise using Stack and recursive approach. Added logger errors and logger info. Also written unit test cases for all scenarios. Did local Jenkin build (attached the screenshot in the email).

Its a Maven project, so please deploy through Maven.

I can walk you through the code if needed, please let me know if you need any other details.

Best Regards,

Deepa
